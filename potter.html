    <p  style="align-items:center;">  Harry James Potter is a fictional character and the titular 
        protagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry,
         who, on his eleventh birthday,
         learns he is a wizard.</p> <p>thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly
          headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends
           Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.</p>
           Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community,
            and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort ,â€“
         the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, 
            Lily and James. <br>The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.
<br>
        Harry is regarded as a fictional icon and has been described by many critics, readers, and audiences as one of the greatest literary 
        and film characters of all time. He is portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe in all eight Harry Potter films from Philosopher's Stone (2001) 
        to Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2 (2011). </p>
